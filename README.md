#### This project is developed using these state of the art technologies: </br>
1. **React.js** </br>
    - Functional Components using Hooks and States
    - JSX
    - JSS
2. **React-Router-DOM** </br>
3. **Redux** </br>
4. **Firebase** </br>

HTML5 is totally replaced with **JSX** and CSS3 is somehow replaced with **JSS** but mostly external CSS is used to make the design more attractive and user-friendly.
